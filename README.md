The folders named project1 are the earlier versions of the wakkerdam Support App.

The wakkerdamSupportApp is a app for supporting the online version of the pretty popular game called "The werewolves of Millers Hollow".
In dutch the game is called "Werewolves of Wakkerdam", hence the "Wakkerdam" in the name.
The support app supports gameleaders by calculating everything that happens and telling them exactly what to post.
It should save them lots of time and prevent lots of calculation errors when dealing with complicated situations.
